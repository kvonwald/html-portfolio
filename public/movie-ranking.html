<h1>The Best Movies According to Kristin</h1>
<h2>My  top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Against All Odds</h3>
<p>Jeff Bridges at his peak.  Loved the vibe of Mexico, living carefree in Mexico.</p>
<h3>Thor:  Ragnarok</h3>
<p>I love the inspirational character of Thor,  He is a hero, a god, and he doesn't know who he is. 
    my favorite line is when Thor feels defeated because he lost his hammer, the source of his power; when 
    his father tells him, <i>You are not the god of hammers.</i>, and he realizes that he is the god of <i>Thunder!</i>
</p>
<h3>I Lost My Body</h3>
<p>This is an animation film in french.  This movie is so unique, it is filmed
    from the perspective of a severed hand.  AN event which leads the main character through n extraordinary journey in self-discovery.
